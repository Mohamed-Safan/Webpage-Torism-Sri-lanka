    Built several years ago on a massive piece of land in Galle, the Galle Dutch Fort was used by the Portuguese until the Dutch took over it. The British finally sealed the fort as theirs with a lot of <br>re-building and renovation. The unique blends that led to the standing of this monumental structure are now listed under the UNESCO World Heritage Sites thus deserving a substantial place on<br> the list of places to visit in Galle.

    The Jungle Beach is an out-of-the-way and serene beach that is a storehouse of all the quiet time you need on your holiday. Located a little ahead of the Japanese Peace Pagoda, this Beach is one of<br> the most relaxed one and is much less swarming than all the other tourist places in Galle. 

    You can sit back on the sandy beach and get a perfect tan, or swim in the clear waters that seem <br>like a mirror image of the ground below. If you are a fan of the aquatic life, then you could spend some time Snorkeling to see for yourself the life of the rich marine life in Galle.

    Nestled in the premise of the Galle Dutch Fort, the Galle Lighthouse is an imperial beauty. The captivating architecture, tall building and the breeze it echoes are all unforgettable scenes that even a<br> camera cannot capture at its best. One can see the far-off oceans that face the lighthouse, which is factually the oldest one in the country. It was a sigh of relief for ancient<br> mariners and is a scintillating sight for tourists today.
