                <p>The main entrance is located in the northern side of the rock.
                    It was designed in the form of a huge stone lion, whose feet have survived up to today but the upper parts of the body were destroyed.Thanks to this lion the palace was named Sigiriya. The term Sigiriya originates from the word Sihagri, i.e. Lion Rock.</p>

                <h1>Eye catching Stroke Paintings</h1>
                <p>The western wall of Sigiriya was almost entirely covered by frescoes, created during the reign of Kasyapa. Eighteen frescoes have survived to this day.
                    The frescoes are depicting nude females and are considered to be either the portraits of Kasyapa's wives and concubines or priestess performing religious rituals.</p>
